   <div class="rsamplediv"><span  class="rclose">&times;</span><p class="rStatementsContents">  <p class="rStatements">Statements</p>As the curtain behind our modern lifestyle falls around us, revealing the devastating consequences of our actions on the environment, humanity is forced to reconcile with our collective role in the disintegration of the natural systems that sustain our planet. Yet, as we bear witness to mass extinction and fading landscapes, 
  <span class="rdots">...</span><span class="rmyBtn" onclick="myFunctionR()">Expand</span><span class="rmore">we continue to treat nature as a system that is external to us: a siloed system that we experience for pleasure, curate for visual aesthetic, and exploit for resources. This anthropocentric perspective and the resulting notion of separation is broken and leading us down a dark path to destruction.

My work invites viewers to imagine a speculative future in which humanity is forced to live indoors due to the dire conditions of the outside world. With little to no access to nature, people are left with a romanticized view of the past, a profound sense of loss, and the weight of fault. As a result, ecological grief has become embedded within this new Post-nature era. As people learn to let go of the physicality of the natural world, they must cope by creating new digital, conceptual, and spiritual relationships with nature and embrace a new ecocentric perspective.  

Through a cautionary glimpse into a world that we could be in the process of creating, my work intends to call attention to the cause and effect relationship between the choices we make today and their implications tomorrow, and poses the question: when is it too late to change? </span></p></div>

  <div class="rsamplediv"> <span  class="rclose">&times;</span><p class="rStatementsContents">IMy work in my thesis projects are about queerness. Queerness, in this case, is not necessarily referring to LGBTQ-specific ideas, but about the movement out of the stasis and constant evolution. It is the never ending cycle of transforming and identifying. Queerness <span class="rdots">...</span><span class="rmyBtn">Expand</span><span class="rmore"> is also an act and strategy that both blurs and challenges the way we see and perceive what’s presented so it’s existence can live in a space between acts of dis-identification and identifying. To put it short, queerness is the never ending push and pull between labeling and transforming.
My method of working involves the constant act of evolving existing ideas, identifying new qualities from this new existence, and transforming it again. I am interested in taking objects, images, and ideas that the audience is familiar with and  push the ways they can exist in the world through magnifying and reducing the visibility of the unique qualities that already exist. The goal is to expand the viewer's  perception of these existing ideas and to pay more attention to the more granular qualities that are already existing but often overlooked.  </span></p></div>

I start to make different cubes from various ingredients. During the process, the most interesting point is unpredictability and the difference between my imagination and the authentic senses when I actually eat them. The final product is the reflection of my own senses and feelings. This development is expected to allow the audience to have a brand-new biting experience.
