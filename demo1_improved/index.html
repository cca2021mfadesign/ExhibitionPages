    	<h2>Curatorial Statements</h2>
     <p>This has been a year of loss, both personal and universal. As design students we’ve lost in person classes, access to resources, time in the studio, and interacting with our friends. But as we’ve also gotten lost. We got lost in the process, lost in our minds. In her book A Field Guide to Getting Lost, Rebecca Solnit says. “Lost really has two disparate meanings. Losing things is about the familiar falling away, getting lost is about the unfamiliar appearing.” In an unfamiliar world, we’ve trudged down dead ends and roamed through uncharted territory, but we managed to steer ourselves and explore and discover new ideas along our way. Our journey of finding unknown destinations brings us all together. Where are we? What the hell (is going on)? celebrates the work created as we’ve navigated through an unfamiliar year of wide unknowns. </p>
     <p>
In a time globally unprecedented, we’ve been working on finding our voices as designers and staking out our territory in the industry, tasks that become increasingly challenging in a world that is changing before our eyes. Aiming at an ever shifting horizon, we’ve wandered with each other through cyberspace to arrive here. The unstable future, the pandemic restricts us, but also opens up an opportunity for creativity. Some argue the advance of technology makes us lose our instinct, or ability to find our way. The journey is the destination, and we lost the fun of discovering; however technology is also another way of getting lost, both equally satisfying. By chance, or intention, we connect the dots, decide to draw our own map and navigate our ways, from place to place, platform to platform. We welcome you to come into our process, and get lost with us into the unknown, and enjoy the lost art of finding our way. And this is not the end, we are still sailing in different directions, sailing into the unknown.</p>
